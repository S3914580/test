            Prior to joining RMIT, I was a student at Prior to joining RMIT, I was a student at  Swinburne in Melbourne, Australia. I finished the Diploma of Information  Technology and 1.5 year of the Bachelor of  Computer Science. But due to the pandemic  situation, I had to go back to Viet Nam and  postponed my studies in Australia. After a year of waiting to continue in Australia,  I decided to transfer to RMIT in Vietnam to  continue. Completed a GameDevHQ Unity course

               Despite having completed the Diploma of IT in Swinburne, IT is not my forte and I am not at all  interested in IT. I am more interested in Computer science that is in the making of games. 
               Even without any interest, I am able to understand the importance of IT in Game Development  and also what IT skills you can learn from Game Dev like: 
               ➢ Programming logic from making games, 
               ➢ Online tools and search engine used to research on the game or the process of making it, ➢ Files and Directories, Compile from exporting games from the engine, ➢ Flash memory, cloud storage and operating system compatibility from copying game files  from systems to systems, 
               ➢ Debugging and software revisions from responding to count less errors during the  development process.
