              My nationality is Vietnamese and I live in Ho Chi Minh City. This is the second semester of my first year in RMIT. I’m Vietnamese and I was born in Ho Chi Minh City. I’ve lived in this city for 19 years. I don’t travel often but I really love travelling. I want to go places that have delicious foods, beautiful scenery and fresh air.  My hobby is watching and reading, but I prefer reading novels. I like outdoor activities such as badminton, swimming, rollerblading. I also like playing piano. My favorite pets are cats especially Munchkins.

          IT interest

          I choose IT because I feel it is very interesting with what we do with technology, I am not suitable to communicate with many people and like to calculate. Moreover, the IT industry has a great job potential when graduating and have good income.
I have become interesting in computer when I am in grade 8. At that time, I had to take a job exam to prepare for the exam when I finished grade 9 and computer science was compulsory subject in my school. I studied about Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Pascal and how to create a basic website. Then I found computer and science is very useful and decided to choose IT when I applied for the university entrance exam.

            These tests are very helpful. When I am doing all question in each test, I know more about myself, how I treat others and vice versa. Futhermore, I was surprised that through my responds, the results of the survey clearly analyzed my personality, where I am suitable to work and who I should be friend with. Although not all results are completely accurate, through it, I gained more experiences on how to make friends and how to work for the best results.

I am not usually a team leader when doing in group, but when we discuss about how to work and reports, I can give many opinions and listen to opinions of other members to be able to choose the best method for assignments. Besides, helping team members is very necessary, when doing the assignment, I can help other members solve their problems within my ability.

When forming a group, I want the team members not necessarily to be really good, but they need to explore, come up with new ideas and help others to accomplish our goals ahead of time. Team members must be responsible for the park they are assigned, respect and help each other, praise and support the effort of others. When there is a problem in group work ( not personal problem), they must discuss it with the whole group to make a decision, not decide on their own.
